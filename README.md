# Origin_Destination_Estimation
# Future work
*  Implementation Focused(Python, Matlab, Julia)
*  Deterministic Model or Stochastic Model
*  Optimisation: eliminate model constrains
*  Make the convergence faster  

# Important topics for interim report:
* Define the research topic: define specific research questions/problems/hypotheses
* Give the background literature that supports the research and identifies the gaps in the knowledge that defines the novelty of the research
* Develop the research methods. Design the appropriate methodology (simulations, experiments, benchmark parameters, …) that will allow the gathering of evidence and the formulation of the conclusion.
* Give the criteria against which to evaluate progress and success.

# Important topics for final report:
* Write a conference of journal paper that could be submitted for publication in the scientific community.
* Identify the reasons why some research methodologies applied where appropriate/inappropriate for the research tasks and give an improvement/alternative of a more effective methodology to achieve the research outcomes.
* Reflect on your own contribution: where did you add to the group effort (e.g. because you measured/simulated a certain set of items the group was able to publish, move forward faster…), where did you propose and test alternative approaches and which of those where implemented or not (why),
* What did you learn? Describe how you see research: aims, tasks and outcomes.
