## Estimation of Origin-Destination Matrix and Assignment Matrix: Blind Estimation and Statistical Approach
## Abstract
This paper presents novel a approach to the origin-destination(OD) matrix estimation problem.
A new linear model is proposed based on O- flows, which allows the estimation of the OD- flows
without prior information of it. Accordingly, a deterministic and rigid model is formulated and
simulations are perform to proof the applicability of the model, the capability of the new model
is demonstrated by simulations. The paper also considers the case when prior information of OD
flow and/or assignment matrix is available, statistical model and maximum likelihood estimator for
the OD-flows are also developed which incorporates historical data of OD-flow. A decomposition
algorithm is proposed to solve the optimization of objective function and its convergence is proved.
Thimplementation of the statistical model is demonstrated on a synthetic network.
## Introduction
In the world today, population growth have resulted in increasingly severe traffic congestion. Effective
transportation polices and control measures can improve traffic safety and quality, as well as accelerate
economic growth and reduce pollution. Both the origin-destination(OD) matrix and traffic flows
assignment on network links are important information for traffic management, operations and urban
planning efforts to mitigate congestion. The former is known as the estimation of OD matrix problem,
and the latter as the estimation of traffic assignment matrix problem.
More specifically, this paper focuses to solve the following problem: Consider a network g(N;L)
with N representing the nodes and L being the set of links. The problem is to estimate both the OD
flows and the link choice proportions from only the link flow information. Another approach is also
formulated when historical information of OD- flow is available.
